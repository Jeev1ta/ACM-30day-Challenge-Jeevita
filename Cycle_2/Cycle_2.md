# Tweet Sentiment Analysis Breakdown – Phase 5 Summary
## Steps Performed:
- Loaded the dataset and selected relevant columns (sentiment and tweet text).
- Cleaned the tweets by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags (kept words), special characters, and converting text to lowercase.
- Mapped sentiment labels from numeric (0, 2, 4) to more intuitive categories: Negative (0), Neutral (1), Positive (2).
- Converted tweet text into numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorization, capturing the importance of words with a vocabulary size limit.
- Split the data into training and test sets and trained a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression / SVM / Naive Bayes / XGBoost).
- Evaluated the model using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score).

## Key Learnings:
- Learned how to process and clean large-scale tweet data by removing noise and standardizing text for analysis.
- Understood how TF-IDF transforms text into meaningful numeric vectors by emphasizing important words across documents.
- Saw how machine learning models can be trained to classify sentiment based on features extracted from text.
- Gained experience in evaluating model performance using metrics like F1-score and visual tools like Confusion Matrices to interpret errors.

I worked on Tweet Sentiment Analysis using the Sentiment140 dataset, applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. I learned how to clean and preprocess large-scale text data, convert it into meaningful numerical features using TF-IDF, and train models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes for classification. I also practiced evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This deepened my understanding of how text data can be analyzed and modeled to extract sentiment and patterns in real-world social media content.
