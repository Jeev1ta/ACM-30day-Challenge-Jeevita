# Tasks Completed:
- Imported and preprocessed the Credit Card dataset
- Performed feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Trained SVM models using:
  - Linear kernel
  - RBF kernel
  - Polynomial kernel (degree=3)
- Evaluated and compared accuracy scores of each kernel
- Plotted bar chart showing accuracy comparison
- Applied PCA to reduce feature space to 2 dimensions
- Visualized predictions using RBF SVM on PCA-transformed data

# Skills Applied:
- SVM theory and kernel comparison
- Handling high-dimensional data with PCA
- Model evaluation and visualization
- No for loops used – models trained and evaluated separately

I explored Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels—linear, RBF, and polynomial—using the Credit Card dataset. I learned how kernel choice affects model accuracy and how to apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization. I also practiced comparing model performance and interpreting results visually. This deepened my understanding of SVM's role in classification tasks.
